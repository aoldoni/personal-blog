# Welcome

This is the repository for my personal website. It was done using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [Minimal](https://github.com/calintat/minimal).

Notes to self:  
- Add a regular and a "bare" git repository in production server.  
- Link "hooks" folder from the regular clone to the bare clone.
